# Project: Diabetes Patients Analysis by MeriSkill

<br>

## Introduction:
Diabetes, a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, requires thorough analysis to understand its impact and implications. In this project, we delve into the data of diabetes patients, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights. By examining variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and more, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of diabetes patients' characteristics and their implications.

## Index of Contents:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

* Data upload using Pandas
* Checking data type and structure
* Handling duplicates, null, or NA values
* Visualization of null values using heatmap
* Correlation analysis using Seaborn heatmap
* Descriptive statistics: mean, count, std, min, max

2. Data Visualization

* Boxplot of key variables to check distribution and outliers: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
* Scatterplot of Age and Pregnancies to visualize distribution and outliers
* Pairplot to analyze relationships between multiple variables
* Count of diabetic (1) and non-diabetic (0) females
* Quick overview of distribution for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in each column
* Histograms comparing differences between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in various variables: Age, Pregnancies, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Blood Pressure
* Boxplot and Pieplot to compare counts between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals

3. Outlier Detection

* Calculation of Inter Quartile Range (IQR) for Pregnancies
* Detection of outliers in Pregnancies and Age

### Outcome:
Through this project, we gain valuable insights into diabetes patients' characteristics and their implications. We uncover key variables contributing to diabetes diagnosis, visualize distributions and relationships, and detect outliers. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals across various demographic and clinical variables. This analysis provides valuable insights for understanding diabetes and informing potential interventions and management strategies.
